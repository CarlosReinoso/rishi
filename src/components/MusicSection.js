                Last year something clicked for Aryan after his first term at school where he had been learning phonics; he discovered a love for music, rhythm, and even beatboxing.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                One evening in their living room, Rishi noticed that Aryan connected to music and enjoyed singing, he turned to Priya and said, "It's time to make a song." She looked at him like, "What are you on about?".
              </p>

              <p>
                What started as a wild idea slowly spiralled into something real. With no prior music experience, Rishi and Aryan took several weeks to write lyrics for the song, continuing to practice each night until it was perfect. They then recorded the track using a kids' headset, a rode mic, and basic recording software. They poured their hearts into every take.
              </p>

              <p>
                From there, they dreamed even bigger; creating a full script for a children's music video with absolutely zero budget. Every scene was built from imagination, determination, and the belief that a message about speech and language delay could be powerful, fun, and full of heart.

                  This song reflects Aryan's struggles and Rishi's encouragement as a father. It was released on World Voice Day along with a heartwarming children's video.

                As part of this project, they launched a fundraiser for Speech and Language UK, setting out to raise £5,000 to support the 2 million children in the UK affected by Speech and Language delays (1 in 5 children).
